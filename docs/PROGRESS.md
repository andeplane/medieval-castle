# Progress

## 2026-11-05: exterior v1

Done
- Layout spec (`src/castle/spec.ts`) and plan tests (`tests/layout.test.ts`).
- Generated textures in workers (`src/render/texgen.ts`): rubble, ashlar, dressed stone, slate, planks, ground layers, water ripples.
- TSL materials (`src/render/materials.ts`) with per-stone variation and world-space weathering.
- Castle exterior generator (`src/castle/castle.ts`): wings with real window openings, buttresses with blind arches, corbel tables and machicolations, crenellations, hip roofs with dormers, chimneys, four towers, gatehouse with portcullis, east turret, courtyard stair tower and well.
- Island revetment (`src/castle/revetment.ts`) and the broken south bridge (`src/castle/bridge.ts`).
- Terrain with moat, banks, farmland, lake and mountains (`src/world/terrain.ts`); sky, sun, IBL, fog (`src/world/sky.ts`); reflective moat (`src/world/water.ts`); ez-tree trees + far forests (`src/world/trees.ts`).
- Orbit / fly / walk cameras with bookmarks; `window.__game` hooks; `npm run shots`.

Numbers (headless WebGL2 capture): castle ~115k triangles; near trees ~2.1M triangles (102 trees) + 11k far canopies; texture generation ~6 s on the container CPU across 3 workers.

Known issues / next
- Near trees are the triangle hog; add impostors (InstancedMesh2 + LOD) before adding more.
- No grass blades yet; island lawn is texture only.
- Far forests are low-poly blobs; swap for impostor cards.
- Stone texture could use a close-up detail normal for first-person distance.
- Courtyard is plain; no doors on the outer walls except the gate.

## 2026-11-05: interior stairs (branch `interior-stairs`)

Done
- `src/castle/interior/stairs.ts`: `buildStair(B, spec, opts)` for the shared `StairSpec` (contract in `src/castle/interior/types.ts`).
  - Spiral newel stairs: stone wedge steps, each with its own newel drum, nosing, worn hollow on the walking line, small tilt; a helical soffit under every step (first-turn steps are solid down to the floor). Rises 0.17–0.198 m; steps per turn chosen from the radius (going ~0.4 m at the walking line), raised until the headroom holds (>= 2.05 m). Landings are wide flat steps centred on each door angle; the planner picks rise counts and turns to hit fixed door angles. Rope handrail on iron staples, optional inner drum skin with door/slit gaps, top wall, ceiling, polygonal stair rooms (`drumPoly`).
  - Straight flights: mural stairs (passage walls + stepped lintels) or open courtyard steps, with mid landings and flat lead-in / run-out when the run is long.
  - `stairCollisionRamp()` (invisible helicoid through the nosings, never below a tread), `stairNavPath()` (walking-line polyline for NPCs, a vertex at every landing), `validateStair()`, `spiralLandingAngles()`, `spiralStartFor()`, `drumWall()`.
  - Randomness is injected (`opts.rng`, default: world seed + stair id); the Builder is passed in.
- `src/castle/interior/stairprobe.ts`: vertical ray casts on the built triangles (rises, goings, headroom, landing heights, NaN/degenerate checks).
- `tests/stairs.test.ts`: plan and geometry checks for the test stair, a tight turret stair, 10 random towers, mural and courtyard flights, nav path, ramp, options. Coverage of the stair modules ~98 % statements / 99.8 % lines.
- `?test=stairs` (`src/debug/stairtest.ts`): a tower (r 2.4, newel 0.3, landings 7/13/19/25 m) with a thick drum, doors, slits and a mural stair up to its door; `&cut` removes half the drum. Bookmarks `stair-up, stair-climb, stair-down, stair-landing, stair-soffit, stair-mural, stair-out, stair-cut`.

Numbers: test spiral 103 steps, 24.7k triangles (~196 stone + ~43 rope/staples per step), ramp ~5k triangles; mural flight 31 steps, 3k triangles.

Known issues / next
- The stone materials are exterior ones: rain streaks and lichen show on treads indoors (needs an interior material variant).
- Fixed door angles that fall badly for a small radius can cost going or headroom; the plan reports it in `stats.problems`. Taking upper door angles from `spiralLandingAngles()` always works.
- The ramp is steeper than 50° within ~0.65 m of the axis on wide stairs (the capsule only gets there hugging the newel).
