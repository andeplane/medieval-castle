## 2026-11-05: procedural prop kit (furniture, not yet placed in the castle)

Sourcing decision (Anders, 2026-11-05): code + free CC0 only; no store packs (their licences forbid shipping raw files from a public repo); Meshy (already paid for) may be used later for a few organic hero props.

Done
- `src/props/geom.ts`: pure `PropMesh` (no three.js): bevelled boxes with hand-made skew/taper, tubes, lathes, parametric sheets, transform stack, vertex tints. One bin per material: wood, iron, cloth, straw, ceramic, wax, flame.
- `src/props/kit.ts`: 29 seeded kinds (trestle table, bench, stool, chair, throne, bed, four-poster, straw pallet, chest, cupboard, shelf with clutter, barrel, crate, sack, bucket, cauldron, tableware, candlestick, sconce + torch, chandelier, weapon rack, armour stand, lectern, altar, book stack, tapestry, rug, firewood, straw heap). Each returns colliders (boxes), light emitters (position, colour, intensity, flicker) and whether it blocks navigation.
- `src/props/place.ts`: merge placed props into one mesh per material, world footprints for navmesh obstacles, the review layout.
- `src/props/textures.ts` + `render.ts`: generated oak, iron, weave, straw, glaze textures; three.js materials and meshes.
- `props.html`: review page (gallery + hall, chamber, store rooms). `URL=http://localhost:5173/props.html npm run shots kit hall chamber store`.
- `npm run coverage`: v8 coverage, thresholds 95 % lines on `src/props` (currently ~99.9 % lines, 97 % branches).

Numbers (headless WebGL2): 140–3.8k triangles per piece (shelf with clutter is the largest); the whole review page is 79 props, ~40k triangles, 7 materials; prop textures generate in < 1 s.

Next
- Hook into the interiors once `interior-shell` lands: `dressRooms(plan, physics)` returns `Map<InteriorGroup key, Object3D>`; recipes per `RoomKind`; keep door swings and stair landings clear; validator for 256 seeds.
- Swap the stand-in materials for `makeInteriorMaterials` from `src/render/interiorLight.ts`; hand emitters to interior-light.
- Looks: tapestry patterns are coarse, the mail shirt reads as a tube, straw heap reads as sand.

## 2026-11-05: exterior v1

Done
- Layout spec (`src/castle/spec.ts`) and plan tests (`tests/layout.test.ts`).
- Generated textures in workers (`src/render/texgen.ts`): rubble, ashlar, dressed stone, slate, planks, ground layers, water ripples.
- TSL materials (`src/render/materials.ts`) with per-stone variation and world-space weathering.
- Castle exterior generator (`src/castle/castle.ts`): wings with real window openings, buttresses with blind arches, corbel tables and machicolations, crenellations, hip roofs with dormers, chimneys, four towers, gatehouse with portcullis, east turret, courtyard stair tower and well.
- Island revetment (`src/castle/revetment.ts`) and the broken south bridge (`src/castle/bridge.ts`).
- Terrain with moat, banks, farmland, lake and mountains (`src/world/terrain.ts`); sky, sun, IBL, fog (`src/world/sky.ts`); reflective moat (`src/world/water.ts`); ez-tree trees + far forests (`src/world/trees.ts`).
- Orbit / fly / walk cameras with bookmarks; `window.__game` hooks; `npm run shots`.

Numbers (headless WebGL2 capture): castle ~115k triangles; near trees ~2.1M triangles (102 trees) + 11k far canopies; texture generation ~6 s on the container CPU across 3 workers.

Known issues / next
- Near trees are the triangle hog; add impostors (InstancedMesh2 + LOD) before adding more.
- No grass blades yet; island lawn is texture only.
- Far forests are low-poly blobs; swap for impostor cards.
- Stone texture could use a close-up detail normal for first-person distance.
- Courtyard is plain; no doors on the outer walls except the gate.
