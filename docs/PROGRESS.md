# Progress

## 2026-11-05: tunnel loading screen

Done
- Loading screen (`src/loading/tunnel.ts`, shader in `tunnel.glsl.ts`): a vaulted rubble tunnel under the moat that starts pitch dark; each boot step lights the next wall torch (nearest first, 8 torches), and the last 7 % brings up a soft fill and daylight through the iron grille at the far bank. Torches strike with a short sputter and then flicker; puddles mirror the flames; in-scattering gives the damp air a glow.
- Own WebGL2 canvas with an analytic ray tracer (floor, walls, barrel vault, end wall), so it is up in the first frame, before the castle renderer, textures and shaders exist. Without WebGL2 the caption alone shows progress. Context is lost and the canvas removed after the fade.
- Matches the castle tunnels (interior-shell): 2.1 m wide, crown 2.65 m, rubble walls and vault with the `rubble` greys from `texgen.ts`, dressed springer course, dressed flagstones.
- Progress comes from the existing `say()` steps in `main.ts` (unknown labels just advance a little) plus per-job texture progress from `texpool.ts` (`setTextureProgress`).
- `index.html` now loads `src/loading/entry.ts` (12 kB gzip), which shows the tunnel at once and then `import()`s `main.ts` (3.2 MB gzip), so the tunnel is up during the download too.
- Structure for tests: `model.ts` (pure progress/torch state), `gl.ts` (renderer over a narrow `GLLike` slice of WebGL2), `tunnel.ts` (DOM + frame loop with injected `LoadingDeps`), `start.ts` (entry logic with injected `EntryDeps`). `npm run coverage` enforces 100 % on `src/loading` (type-safe fakes in `tests/loading/fakes.ts`).
- Review: `?loading=<0..1>` holds the tunnel at a progress value, `?loading=demo` loops a fake load; `node scripts/loading-shots.mjs [p …]` captures `shots/loading-<p>.png`. Honours `prefers-reduced-motion` (no camera drift or flicker).

Next
- Swap the procedural stone for the castle's own stone textures once the stone-closeup work lands, if the look should match exactly (they are generated after the loading screen starts, so it would need a cached copy).

## 2026-11-05: exterior v1

Done
- Layout spec (`src/castle/spec.ts`) and plan tests (`tests/layout.test.ts`).
- Generated textures in workers (`src/render/texgen.ts`): rubble, ashlar, dressed stone, slate, planks, ground layers, water ripples.
- TSL materials (`src/render/materials.ts`) with per-stone variation and world-space weathering.
- Castle exterior generator (`src/castle/castle.ts`): wings with real window openings, buttresses with blind arches, corbel tables and machicolations, crenellations, hip roofs with dormers, chimneys, four towers, gatehouse with portcullis, east turret, courtyard stair tower and well.
- Island revetment (`src/castle/revetment.ts`) and the broken south bridge (`src/castle/bridge.ts`).
- Terrain with moat, banks, farmland, lake and mountains (`src/world/terrain.ts`); sky, sun, IBL, fog (`src/world/sky.ts`); reflective moat (`src/world/water.ts`); ez-tree trees + far forests (`src/world/trees.ts`).
- Orbit / fly / walk cameras with bookmarks; `window.__game` hooks; `npm run shots`.

Numbers (headless WebGL2 capture): castle ~115k triangles; near trees ~2.1M triangles (102 trees) + 11k far canopies; texture generation ~6 s on the container CPU across 3 workers.

Known issues / next
- Near trees are the triangle hog; add impostors (InstancedMesh2 + LOD) before adding more.
- No grass blades yet; island lawn is texture only.
- Far forests are low-poly blobs; swap for impostor cards.
- Stone texture could use a close-up detail normal for first-person distance.
- Courtyard is plain; no doors on the outer walls except the gate.
